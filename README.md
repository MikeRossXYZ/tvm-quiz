# Time-Value-of-Money-Quiz
My quest to build a PWA that gets a perfect score on Google PageSpeed Insights 

Status:

* Working implementation with basic TVM questions
* PageSpeed Insights:
  * Perfect scores on PWA, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.
  * 97/100 on Performance due to "Defer unused CSS" -> resulting from importing the Bootstrap CSS library

Roadmap: 

* Advanced TVM questions
* Scoreboard (requires accompaning backend server)
* Two stage questions
